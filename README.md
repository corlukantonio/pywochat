## Description

**Pywochat** is the name of the project created as a simple software solution for the completion of the Python workshop held in the premises of the Faculty of Organization and Informatics in Vara≈ædin. The main purpose of the application is to enable a conversation through a simple interface with any person who has created an account within the application. All you have to do is create your account, log in and start chatting.

## Setting WSL and Docker

## How to run it?

Before you start doing any of the following, make sure you have [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installed on your computer.

One important change to make within the [app.py](https://github.com/corlukantonio/pywochat/blob/master/app.py) document, if you are going to run it on localhost, is to change the ENV variable.

```python
# If running on localhost set this to 'dev'
ENV = 'prod'
```

### Setting the virtualenv

If you have not already installed **virtualenv** and **pipenv**, do so by opening the Anaconda Prompt and entering the following.

```properties
pip install virtualenv
pip install pipenv
```

Navigate to the repository, create and then activate a new virtualenv inside it by entering the following.

```properties
virtualenv pywochat
pywochat\Scripts\activate
```

Install the dependencies inside of the newly created virtualenv.

```properties
pipenv install
```

### Setting the database

Open the **pgAdmin** in your browser and create a new database called "**pywochat**". After creating the database, the next step is to create the necessary tables. Run the python interpreter.

```properties
python
```

To create tables from the models defined in app.py, enter the following commands.

```python
from app import db
db.create_all()
exit()
```

### And finally, run it!

Navigate to the pywochat, and start the web application by typing the following.

```properties
python app.py
```
